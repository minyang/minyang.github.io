Hi Everyone, my name is Min Yang Jung.  I work at Intuitive Surgical Inc., which
manufactures the world's best and safest surgical robot systems.
</p>

<p>
I love designing and building software infrastructure for safety-critical real-time robot control systems, primarily in the area of medical and surgical robotics. I strive for systematic methods and software architectures that can facilitate the design, implementation, and verification and validation testing of robot control systems with emphasis on safety. I have multiple years of hands-on experience with the development of software systems both in academia and in industry.
