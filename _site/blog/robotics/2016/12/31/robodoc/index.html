  <h1 class="post-title">ROBODOC® System</h1>
  <span class="post-date">31 Dec 2016</span>
  <p>When I decided to work on the software system safety as my PhD thesis topic, it
didn’t take long before I realized safety in the medical robotics domain had not
yet been formulated as a well-defined research problem.  Although virtually
all papers in the medical robotics domain mention (the importance of) safety, it
has been mostly considered in the application- or system-specific context,
rather than as a system property that requires systematic approaches.</p>

<p>So I spent quite a bit of time – almost a year – for literature review in
various areas such as software engineering, component-based software
engineering, system safety engineering, safety- and mission-critical application
domains, dependable computing domain, and so on. Two major findings (I’ll write
another post that overviews those related domains later):</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>Within</em> medical robotics, there is a lack of prior work that specifically
focus on the safety of medical robots.</li>
  <li><em>Outside</em> medical robotics, Safety has been already recognized as one of
crucial system properties and as such there is a substantial body of work
around it.</li>
</ol>

<p>This was a good news to me in that I had room for contributions, but at the same
time was not a good news because there were not much of prior work that I could
refer to for my research.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there was one medical robot system, of which many aspects are
<em>relatively</em> well documented and published in the academic medical robotics
literature: The <strong>ROBODOC® system</strong> system, an orthopedic surgical robot system.
Starting from its history, the topics they cover include user-driven system
design requirements, an overall system architecture, design rationale, safety
design principles, and some of engineering details. Even though most of these
papers were published in the 90’s, I personally learned a lot from those
articles, which later became my primary resource for my own research on safety,
including my PhD dissertation. So I thought a list of those papers with the
history of the ROBODOC system may be useful for those who are curious about
ROBODOC, who are interested in safety in general, or who are (about to) working
on safety as a research topic. The list of the literature that I reviewed
includes Taylor <em>et al.</em> (1990, 1991, 1994, 1996), Kazanzides <em>et al.</em> (1992,
1993, 1995, 1996, 1999), Mittelstadt <em>et al.</em> (1993, 1996), and Cain <em>et al.</em>
(1993). For a complete list, please refer to the Reference section at the bottom
of this article.</p>

<p><u><strong><strong>DISCLAIMER</strong></strong></u>:
This article is an excerpt of <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwGcEiVvK4n9RUJmSXhUYW90SG8/view">my PhD dissertation</a>
(Section 6.2.1), which was proofread by <a href="http://smarts.lcsr.jhu.edu/people/peter-kazanzides/">Dr. Peter Kazanzides</a>
and <a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~rht">Dr.  Russell H. Taylor</a>. Dr. Kazanzides is a co-founder
of the Integrated Surgical System (ISS), a manufacturer of the ROBODOC system,
and was the Director of Engineering of ISS. Dr. Taylor designed and prototyped
an earlier version of the ROBODOC system for a veterinary orthopedic surgery at
the IBM Research in the late 80’s.</p>

<h2 id="overview-of-the-robodoc-system">Overview of the ROBODOC System</h2>

<p>The ROBODOC® system has been developed to increase the accuracy and efficacy of
surgical procedures such as cementless Total Hip Replacement (THR) surgery and
Total Knee Replacement (TKR) surgery by enabling surgeons to precisely specify
the desired prosthesis placement in a preoperative CT scan of the patient and
then use the robotic system to accurately machine the bone to achieve that plan.</p>

<p>It began as a joint project between the University of California, Davis and IBM
Research. The canine system (alpha prototype) was developed for canine THR in a
well-controlled, supervised research environment, i.e., under the active
supervision of the developing engineers. It was first clinically used in 1990
for canine patients at a veterinary hospital in Sacramento, California and
performed canine surgeries. This alpha prototype went through fundamental
changes and improvements to evolve into a beta (investigational) medical device
that was operated by surgical teams –- without engineers –- for human clinical
trials at multiple clinical sites. The beta version of ROBODOC was the subject
of an FDA-authorized, multi-center clinical trial in the United States, and
performed over 200 surgeries at a hospital in Frankfurt, Germany. It was then
further developed as a commercial-level product to be used in Europe and this
required an architectural change from a centralized architecture to a
distributed architecture.</p>

<p>The following figure shows the ROBODOC System. The two main components of the
ROBODOC System are the ORTHODOC™ Preoperative Planning System (ORTHODOC) and the
ROBODOC Surgical Assistant (ROBODOC). ORTHODOC allows the surgeon to develop a
preoperative plan that ROBODOC can execute. The two inputs to ORTHODOC are a
Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the patient’s femur and a set of implant models
based on data from the implant manufacturers. Using implant models and a
three-dimensional model of the femur constructed from the CT data, the surgeon
visually determines an appropriate implant model with its precise location. Once
the plan is finalized, the preoperative plan is recorded and transferred to
ROBODOC via a transfer medium (tape or CD).</p>

</figure>

<p>ROBODOC reads the preoperative plan from the transfer medium and machines a
cavity for the implant in the femur according to the plan. To precisely execute
the plan, it is required to register the patient’s femur in the preoperative
plan with the intraoperative physical reality (i.e., the robot’s workspace
coordinates). Calibration of the robot kinematic parameters and the cutting
tool’s dimensional parameters also play a vital role in achieving high
dimensional accuracy. Based on clinical input, the specification of the robot’s
placement accuracy (deviation from the preoperatively planned position) is less
than 1.0 mm, and that of the dimensional accuracy (deviation of the machined
shape from its ideal dimensions) is less than ±0.4 mm on a cross-section (or
±0.2 mm on each side).</p>

<h2 id="safety-features-of-robodoc">Safety Features of ROBODOC</h2>

<p>The principal safety requirements of ROBODOC were defined by a surgeon, who was a user of the system, as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>The robot should never “run away”</em>: No single-mode hardware failure or system
  error should cause the application software to lose control of the robot
  motions.</li>
  <li><em>The robot should never exert excessive force on the patient</em>: Any cutting
  force substantially more than needed means something may be wrong and the
  robot better stop its current motion.</li>
  <li><em>The robot’s cutter should stay within a pre-specified positional envelope
  relative to the volume being cut</em>: A systematic positional shift in the
  placement or shape of the hole should be prevented.</li>
  <li><em>The surgeon must be in charge at all times</em>: The system must provide the
  surgeon with timely information about its current status and the surgeon
  must be able to stop motions at any time.</li>
</ul>

<p>A set of safety features distributed throughout the system were designed to
achieve these principle safety requirements. The following presents a <em>partial</em>
list of the safety features of ROBODOC based only on the <em>published, academic</em>
literature.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>System integrity monitoring (with redundant sensors)</strong>: The real-time
control loop periodically monitors system integrity, such as tolerance
checking of primary and redundant encoders at each joint, with the capability
to turn off the robot arm.</li>
  <li><strong>Use of state variables for error handling</strong> : State variables are defined
to represent application-specific procedural flow and are used for error or
exception handling.</li>
  <li><strong>Dedicated processor for the safety system</strong> : The safety system runs on a
separate processor to isolate it from errors in other subsystems and has a
direct hardware interface to power othe system.</li>
  <li><strong>Force/torque checks with two thresholds</strong> : Force and torque feedback from
the force sensor are monitored against two thresholds, PAUSE (1.5 kg-f) and
STOP (3.0 kg-f). PAUSE halts all robot motion and turns off the cutter,
whereas STOP removes power from both the robot and the cutter.</li>
  <li><strong>Speed limiter (low speed)</strong>: The low-level software implements the speed
limiter. It operates on the output of the trajectory generation functions and
limits the robot’s speed and torque. The rationale of this safety feature is
that the surgical staff can stop the robot before any hazard occurs if the
robot is slow and weak.</li>
  <li><strong>Safety volume (dynamic constraints)</strong>: During cutting, the software
verifies that the cutter tip is within a pre-planned safety volume, with a 3
mm margin for error. The safety volume is derived from the prosthesis
geometry, but is independent from the file containing the cutting paths.</li>
  <li><strong>Notification of exceptions to application</strong> : Any reflex action initiated
by a safety system leads to an exception to the application which interrupts
the normal procedural flow and invokes a handler function for error
recovery.</li>
  <li><strong>Error detection</strong> : Data integrity checks (e.g., if there is any corruption
of critical data), data rationality checks (e.g., if case-specific data are
reasonable), detection of procedural errors (e.g., if surgeons make
procedural errors that can compromise both safety and system performance).</li>
  <li><strong>Startup diagnostics</strong> : During start up, all safety- and
performance-related components are verified to make sure that they are
functioning within specified tolerances.</li>
  <li><strong>User oversight with emergency pause/stop</strong> : An external custom pendant
with five buttons, including emergency pause and stop, helps surgeons to
interact with the system and a graphical display in the operating room
provides the current status of the surgical procedure.</li>
