Taylor\n[http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~rht]. Dr. Kazanzides is a co-founder of the Integrated\nSurgical System (ISS), a manufacturer of the ROBODOC system, and was the\nDirector of Engineering of ISS. Dr. Taylor designed and prototyped an earlier\nversion of the ROBODOC system for a veterinary orthopedic surgery at the IBM\nResearch in the late 80’s.\n\nOverview of the ROBODOC System\nThe ROBODOC® system has been developed to increase the accuracy and efficacy of\nsurgical procedures such as cementless Total Hip Replacement (THR) surgery and\nTotal Knee Replacement (TKR) surgery by enabling surgeons to precisely specify\nthe desired prosthesis placement in a preoperative CT scan of the patient and\nthen use the robotic system to accurately machine the bone to achieve that plan.\n\nIt began as a joint project between the University of California, Davis and IBM\nResearch. The canine system (alpha prototype) was developed for canine THR in a\nwell-controlled, supervised research environment, i.e., under the active\nsupervision of the developing engineers. It was first clinically used in 1990\nfor canine patients at a veterinary hospital in Sacramento, California and\nperformed canine surgeries. This alpha prototype went through fundamental\nchanges and improvements to evolve into a beta (investigational) medical device\nthat was operated by surgical teams –- without engineers –- for human clinical\ntrials at multiple clinical sites. The beta version of ROBODOC was the subject\nof an FDA-authorized, multi-center clinical trial in the United States, and\nperformed over 200 surgeries at a hospital in Frankfurt, Germany. It was then\nfurther developed as a commercial-level product to be used in Europe and this\nrequired an architectural change from a centralized architecture to a\ndistributed architecture.\n\nThe following figure shows the ROBODOC System. The two main components of the\nROBODOC System are the ORTHODOC™ Preoperative Planning System (ORTHODOC) and the\nROBODOC Surgical Assistant (ROBODOC). ORTHODOC allows the surgeon to develop a\npreoperative plan that ROBODOC can execute. The two inputs to ORTHODOC are a\nComputed Tomography (CT) scan of the patient’s femur and a set of implant models\nbased on data from the implant manufacturers. Using implant models and a\nthree-dimensional model of the femur constructed from the CT data, the surgeon\nvisually determines an appropriate implant model with its precise location. Once\nthe plan is finalized, the preoperative plan is recorded and transferred to\nROBODOC via a transfer medium (tape or CD).\n\nORTHODOC: Preoperative PlanningROBODOC: Surgical RobotROBODOC reads the\npreoperative plan from the transfer medium and machines a cavity for the implant\nin the femur according to the plan. To precisely execute the plan, it is\nrequired to register the patient’s femur in the preoperative plan with the\nintraoperative physical reality (i.e., the robot’s workspace coordinates).\nCalibration of the robot kinematic parameters and the cutting tool’s dimensional\nparameters also play a vital role in achieving high dimensional accuracy. Based\non clinical input, the specification of the robot’s placement accuracy\n(deviation from the preoperatively planned position) is less than 1.0 mm, and\nthat of the dimensional accuracy (deviation of the machined shape from its ideal\ndimensions) is less than ±0.4 mm on a cross-section (or ±0.2 mm on each side).\n\nSafety Features of ROBODOC\nThe principal safety requirements of ROBODOC were defined by a surgeon, who was\na user of the system, as follows:\n\n * The robot should never “run away”: No single-mode hardware failure or system\n   error should cause the application software to lose control of the robot\n   motions.\n * The robot should never exert excessive force on the patient: Any cutting\n   force substantially more than needed means something may be wrong and the\n   robot better stop its current motion.\n * The robot’s cutter should stay within a pre-specified positional envelope\n   relative to the volume being cut: A systematic positional shift in the\n   placement or shape of the hole should be prevented.\n * The surgeon must be in charge at all times: The system must provide the\n   surgeon with timely information about its current status and the surgeon must\n   be able to stop motions at any time.\n\nA set of safety features distributed throughout the system were designed to\nachieve these principle safety requirements. The following presents a partial \nlist of the safety features of ROBODOC based only on the published, academic \nliterature.\n\n 1.  System integrity monitoring (with redundant sensors): The real-time control\n     loop periodically monitors system integrity, such as tolerance checking of\n     primary and redundant encoders at each joint, with the capability to turn\n     off the robot arm.\n 2.  Use of state variables for error handling: State variables are defined to\n     represent application-specific procedural flow and are used for error or\n     exception handling.\n 3.  Dedicated processor for the safety system: The safety system runs on a\n     separate processor to isolate it from errors in other subsystems and has a\n     direct hardware interface to power othe system.\n 4.  Force/torque checks with two thresholds: Force and torque feedback from the\n     force sensor are monitored against two thresholds, PAUSE (1.5 kg-f) and\n     STOP (3.0 kg-f). PAUSE halts all robot motion and turns off the cutter,\n     whereas STOP removes power from both the robot and the cutter.\n 5.  Speed limiter (low speed): The low-level software implements the speed\n     limiter. It operates on the output of the trajectory generation functions\n     and limits the robot’s speed and torque. The rationale of this safety\n     feature is that the surgical staff can stop the robot before any hazard\n     occurs if the robot is slow and weak.\n 6.  Safety volume (dynamic constraints): During cutting, the software verifies\n     that the cutter tip is within a pre-planned safety volume, with a 3 mm\n     margin for error. The safety volume is derived from the prosthesis\n     geometry, but is independent from the file containing the cutting paths.\n 7.  Notification of exceptions to application: Any reflex action initiated by a\n     safety system leads to an exception to the application which interrupts the\n     normal procedural flow and invokes a handler function for error recovery.\n 8.  Error detection: Data integrity checks (e.g., if there is any corruption of\n     critical data), data rationality checks (e.g., if case-specific data are\n     reasonable), detection of procedural errors (e.g., if surgeons make\n     procedural errors that can compromise both safety and system performance).\n 9.  Startup diagnostics: During start up, all safety- and performance-related\n     components are verified to make sure that they are functioning within\n     specified tolerances.\n 10. User oversight with emergency pause/stop: An external custom pendant with\n     five buttons, including emergency pause and stop, helps surgeons to\n     interact with the system and a graphical display in the operating room\n     provides the current status of the surgical procedure.\n\nREFERENCES\nROBODOC Literature\nThis is a list of the academic literature on the ROBODOC System that I have\nreviewed focusing on its system design and safety features.
