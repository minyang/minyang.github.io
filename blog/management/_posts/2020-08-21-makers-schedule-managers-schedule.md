I just came across an article titled [maker's schedule, manager's schedule](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html).  It was
published a bit while ago (July 2009).  It describes the two types of schedule – maker's
and manager's – and expands the nature of each.  Essentially, the manager's schedule runs
on hourly basis, whereas the maker's needs a chunk of time like half a day at least.  The
article also talked about what happens when the two schedules meet and how to best utilize
one's time in general.

This article got me thinking, how effectively I have been using my time these days.  My
calendar this week happened to be fairly fragmented – writing technical publication,
working on formal documentation, a bit of coding, developing new
workflows/processes.  There was not much space for me to have quality maker's
time.  Given that my mind operates with a single thread, such fragmentation is
quite costly for me due to frequent context switches, which comes with high cost.

One take away for me is to take more deliberate approach to scheduling my time while
balancing out the maker's and manager's schedule.
