For the past couple years at work, I have been writing quite a bit of shell scripts for
multiple projects.  Most of them are to leverage the power of the shell
scripts to automate development workflows such as build, packaging, deploy, and software release.

Among [many variants of shells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_command_shells),
I primarily use [Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) whenever
possible.  Over time, I noticed that there are some code snippets that I have
been repeatedly using and certain tips I found useful when writing and debugging
bash scripts.  This post compiles such code snippets and tips.

Hope you find these useful as well.  Enjoy Bash-ing!

## Logging

### Showing messages while logging to file

Sometimes it is necessary to show messages to the console, i.e., the standard
output (`stdout`) and the standard error (`stderr`)
while dumping those messages to a log file.  This can be easily
achieved in Bash using the `exec` command.  `exec` is a built-in Bash command that
can redirect the output of the current process.  Combined with `tee`, we can use
`exec` as follows:

```bash
log_file="/tmp/log.txt"
exec >  >(tee -ia $log_file)
exec 2> >(tee -ia $log_file >&2)
```

### Colored Output

```bash
NC='\033[0m'
BLACK='\033[0;30m'
RED='\033[0;31m'
GREEN='\033[0;32m'
YELLOW='\033[0;33m'
BLUE='\033[0;34m'
PURPLE='\033[0;35m'
CYAN='\033[0;36m'
WHITE='\033[1;37m'

fatal()   { echo -e "${RED}ERROR: $1${NC}"; exit 1; }
error()   { echo -e "${RED}ERROR: $1${NC}"; }
warning() { echo -e "${YELLOW}$1${NC}"; }
info()    { echo -e "${GREEN}$1${NC}"; }
message() { echo -e "$1"; }
debug()   { echo -e "${CYAN}$1${NC}"; }
```

## Debugging

[Debugging Bash scripts](https://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/sect_02_03.html)
from the [Bash Guide for Beginners](https://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/index.html)

### `run()`: Run command with error handling and call stack

One of the recurring patterns with bash scripts is to run a command, check if the command
succeeds, and exit immediately with an error message if the command failed.  For example,
let's say I want to recursively copy `src_dir` to `dest_dir`:

```bash
mkdir $dest_dir
cp -R $src_dir $dest_dir
```

Of course, adding a bit of error handling:
```bash
mkdir $dest_dir
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "ERROR: Failed to create $dest_dir"
  exit 1
fi

cp -R $src_dir $dest_dir
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "ERROR: Failed to copy $src_dir to $dest_dir"
  exit 1
fi
```

This simple error handling may work if this code was part of a single script.  If it
was, however, one of bash scripts that were sourced or executed by another scripts
possibly with multiple depths of caller functions, it is not straightforward to
identify the exact spot of a failure based on such a simple error message.

In this situation, wouldn't it be nice if we could print out a user-defined error message
with a call stack that shows file names and line numbers?  `run()` is a small helper
function that does exactly this:

```bash
#
# How to use:
#
# $ run "<mssage>"\
#       "<command>"\
#       "<error mssage>"
#
# If DEBUG is defined as a non-empty value, <message> and <command>
# are printed out as well.
#
run() {
  local msg=$1      # message to print
  local cmd=$2      # command to run
  local err_msg=$3  # error message to print if cmdn fails

  echo -n "$msg ... "
  if [ -n "$DEBUG" ]; then
    echo "$cmd"
    eval "$cmd"
    result=$?
  else
    eval "$cmd" 2>&1 > /dev/null
    result=$?
  fi

  [ $result -eq 0 ] && { echo "OK"; return; }

  echo "$err_msg"
  echo "-- Failed command: $cmd"
  echo "-- Call stack:"

  count=0
  for src in ${BASH_SOURCE[*]}; do
    [ $count -eq 0 ] && line=$LINENO || line=${BASH_LINENO[count-1]}
    echo_yellow "[$count] $src:$line"
    ((count++))
  done
  [ -n "$BASE_ERROR_CODE" ] && exit $BASE_ERROR_CODE || exit 1
}
```

A few examples showing how to use it:

```bash
run "Executing a single command"\
    "mkdir $dest_dir"\
    "Failed to create dest directory: $dest_dir"

run "Executing multiple commands"\
    "mkdir $dest_dir && \
     cp -R $src_dir $dest_dir"\
    "Failed to run multiple commands"

run "Executing a single command and store result in the variable"\
    "files=$(find . -type f -name '*.png')"\
    "Failed to create dest directory: $dest_dir"
echo "${files[@]}"
```

## Shortcuts

A short list of bash shortcuts that I frequently use:

| Navigation | Description |
|---|---|
| `Ctrl`+`a` | Go to the beginning of the line |
| `Ctrl`+`e` | Go to the end of the line |
| `Ctrl`+`x`+`x` | Toggle between the current position and the beginning of the line |
| `Alt`+`f` | Move the cursor forward by one word |
| `Alt`+`b` | Move the cursor backward by one word |

| Shell | Description |
|---|---|
| `Ctrl`+`d` | Exit the current shell |
| `Ctrl`+`l` | Clear the current shell screen.  Same as `clear` command. |

| Editing | Description |
|---|---|
| `Ctrl`+`k` | Remove the line from the cursor to the end of the line |
| `Ctrl`+`u` | Remove the line from the cursor to the beginning of the line |

**TIP:** To use `Alt` in Mac, turn on `Use Option as Meta Key`:

## Others

### Get path, directory, and name of the current script

```bash
SCRIPT_PATH=$(realpath $0)
SCRIPT_DIR=$(dirname "${SCRIPT_PATH}")
SCRIPT_NAME=$(basename "${SCRIPT_PATH}")
```

If `realpath` is not available (e.g., on Mac):

```bash
SCRIPT_PATH="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)/$(basename "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")"
```

### Measure and print elapsed time in human readable format

It is sometimes necessary to measure time to execute a code block and print the
elapsed time in a human readable format.  The following code snippets could be
useful for such a case:

```bash
convertsecs() {
  ((h=${1}/3600))
  ((m=(${1}%3600)/60))
  ((s=${1}%60))
  printf "%02d:%02d:%02d\n" $h $m $s
}

tic=$(date +'%s')  # '%s.%N' for nanoseconds if the system supports
#
# <do something here>
#
toc=$(date +'%s')
elapsed=$(($toc - $tic))

echo "Elapsed time: $(convertsecs $elapsed)"
```
