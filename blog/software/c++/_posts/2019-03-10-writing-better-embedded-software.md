I came across a video recording of a [key note talk by Dan
Saks](https://isocpp.org/blog/2019/03/writing-better-embedded-software-dan-saks-keynote-meeting-embedded-2018)
from Meeting Embedded 2018. &nbsp;Dan Saks, who served as secretary of the ANSI
and ISO C++ standards committee, talks about embedded software development
around C and C++. &nbsp;Some of the topics he addresses include the definition
of embedded systems, the barriers (in mindset) for embedded/C developers to
transition from C to C++, and his approaches to introducing C++ to embedded/C
developers based on his experience.

This talk was interesting to me because he delineated the characteristics of
embedded systems, design considerations that embedded software developers
typically consider (e.g., power budget, thermal effects), and how/what embedded
software developers think.
