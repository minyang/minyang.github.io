Let's cut to the chase â€“ check out this blog article:

[PAC-MAN Recreated with AI by NVIDIA Researchers](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/05/22/gamegan-research-pacman-anniversary) (from NVIDIA blog)

A researcher at NVIDIA,  [Seung Wook Kim](https://seung-kim.github.io/seungkim) (CS PhD
student at U. of Toronto), developed an AI model called the GameGAN, trained it with human
game play data, and used it to re-generate the PAC-MAN game.  According to the
[GameGAN project website](https://nv-tlabs.github.io/gameGAN):

> GameGAN is a generative model that learns to visually imitate a desired game by ingesting screenplay and keyboard actions during training.

This work was published as a CVPR 2020 paper (preprint to be published on May 25th, 2020).

I am a huge fan of old classical games (Lode Runner is my favorite) and this is very
interesting!  Although I have not yet started looking into the area of ML/AI, this work
appears something that I'd definitely love to dig more into.
