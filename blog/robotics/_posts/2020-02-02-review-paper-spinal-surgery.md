I recently came across a review paper on robot-assisted spinal surgeries from Stanford (published on November 7, 2019):

* Marissa Dâ€™Souza, *et al.*, "Robotic-Assisted Spine Surgery: History, Efficacy,
Cost, And Future Trends," in Robotic Surgery: Research and Reviews, Vol. 2019:6 pp. 9-23.
(DOI: [10.2147/RSRR.S190720](https://doi.org/10.2147/RSRR.S190720))

This paper briefly describes the history of minimally invasive surgery (MIS)
focusing on neurosurgery.  It presents some surgical robots that are currently
available in the market, including robots (SpineAssist, Renaissance, Mazor X)
from Mazor, the ROSA Spine from Zimmer Biomet Robotics, the Da Vinci from
Intuitive, and the Excelsius GPS from Globus Medical.  With a review of clinical
outcomes and accuracy, the paper discusses cost-benefit analysis followed by
room for future improvements.

Decent reading for those who are interested in commercially available robots in
the area of neurosurgery.
