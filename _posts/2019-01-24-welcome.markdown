Hi, Iâ€™m Min Yang Jung.

I love designing and building software infrastructure for safety-critical real-time robot control systems, primarily in the area of medical and surgical robotics. I strive for systematic methods and software architectures that can facilitate the design, implementation, and verification and validation testing of robot control systems with emphasis on safety. I have multiple years of hands-on experience with the development of software systems both in academia and in industry.

More about me and my prior work are available on the left, and I can be reached via [Contact](https://minyangjung.com/#/contact).

Thanks for your visit!
